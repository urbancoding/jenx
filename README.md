Note: Due to Appleâ€™s abandonment of the Objective-C Garbage Collector (libauto) which MacRuby 
relied heavily on and hence Jenx relied on, future development of Jenx is on an indefinite hiatus.

A [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) build server monitor for Mac OS X, powered by [MacRuby](http://macruby.com/).
This app sits in your status bar and reports the status of all your Jenkins builds.
Click on a job, and it opens it up in your browser. It even supports [Growl](http://growl.info/)!
